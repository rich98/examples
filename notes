Despite the implementation of climate control systems, environmental monitoring, and staff awareness measures, a residual risk remains due to unfavourable environmental conditions such as temperature fluctuations, humidity, and unauthorized ventilation in sensitive areas like server rooms. These factors can lead to malfunctions of technical components, damage to storage media, or even health risks to personnel. The impact of such incidents is assessed as major, particularly in the context of IT infrastructure and employee safety, while the likelihood is considered possible, especially during transitional weather seasons. Current controls are generally effective, but human error and sudden environmental changes introduce uncertainty. Therefore, the residual risk is classified as medium.

This level of risk is accepted based on current operational requirements and control capabilities. Ongoing efforts such as regular HVAC maintenance, automated alerts for climate deviations, and staff training on ventilation policies are in place to manage and contain the risk. The situation will be reviewed regularly, especially during seasonal transitions or after any incident related to environmental controls.
