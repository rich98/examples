Although technical and organizational controls such as user authentication, access management policies, and audit logging are in place, a residual risk remains concerning the unauthorised use of devices and systems. Even systems with strong identification and authentication mechanisms can be compromised, particularly if security credentials are lost or misused, or if authorisations are assigned incorrectly or not updated promptly. The impact of such an event is considered major, especially in cases involving unauthorised administration, which can result in configuration errors, data manipulation, or serious system outages. The likelihood is assessed as possible, given the persistent risk of human error, social engineering, and lapses in access control processes. The current control environment is effective, but not immune to breakdowns in complex or fast-changing operational contexts, resulting in a residual risk rated as medium.

To mitigate this risk, the following measures are in place:

Implementation of the principle of least privilege, ensuring users have only the access they need.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative and high-risk accounts.

Regular access reviews and audits, including timely revocation of unused or unnecessary accounts.

Role-based access control (RBAC) to streamline and standardize permissions.

Security awareness training for staff on credential hygiene and phishing prevention.

Logging and real-time monitoring of privileged account activity and system changes.
