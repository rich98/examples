Although effective technical and organizational controls are in place to mitigate the risk of IT-supported attacks, a residual risk remains due to the complexity and interconnectedness of modern information systems. This includes the possibility of unintended consequences, such as impacts on third parties or systems not directly targeted. Given the inherent limitations in identifying all system dependencies, and considering that the likelihood is possible and the impact may be major, this residual risk is assessed as high.

After careful evaluation, this residual risk is accepted within the current risk tolerance of the organization. It is acknowledged that while full mitigation is not feasible, continuous monitoring, incident response planning, and awareness training are in place to manage potential consequences. This acceptance is documented and will be reviewed periodically or upon significant changes to the threat landscape or system architecture.
