L.01 – Information Security Policy (System-Based Perspective)
Control Description
Establish, implement, and maintain a system-wide information security policy supported by aligned processes and documented procedures.
The information security policy acts as the central component of the organization's security management system. It defines the governing principles, roles, and standardized practices required to protect both digital and physical assets. As a system control, it ensures that information security is managed holistically and integrated into all business functions. The policy, along with its supporting operational components, provides consistency, direction, and enforceable expectations across the organizational system. Without a defined and coordinated framework, the system lacks coherence, increasing operational risk and undermining overall security resilience.
Risk Statement
Failure to define and implement a system-wide, structured information security policy—along with standardized supporting processes—creates a disjointed security posture. In such a fragmented system, departments may adopt inconsistent safeguards, fail to interpret security requirements accurately, or circumvent established protocols. This leads to uncoordinated risk management, unmanaged vulnerabilities, and misaligned decisions that do not support overarching organizational goals. Ultimately, this degrades the integrity of the system, elevating the likelihood of security incidents, compliance failures, and operational inefficiencies.
Business Impact
•	System-wide exposure to unauthorized access, data breaches, or loss of confidentiality
•	Deviation from regulatory and compliance requirements (e.g., ISO 27001, GDPR)

L.08 – Access Control Policy (System-Based Perspective)
Control Description
Develop and implement a comprehensive, system-integrated access control policy that governs how access to information and information processing facilities is requested, authorized, provisioned, monitored, and revoked across the organization.
A robust access control policy is essential to the secure operation of an information security management system (ISMS). It defines the rules, responsibilities, and technical controls necessary to enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring that only authorized individuals and systems have access to sensitive resources. This policy must address both logical access (e.g., system logins, applications, data repositories) and physical access (e.g., data centers, secure offices), covering all phases of the access lifecycle—from onboarding to offboarding.
Risk Statement
Without a well-defined and enforced access control policy, unauthorized individuals may gain access to sensitive data or critical systems, increasing the risk of intentional or accidental compromise. Inconsistent or ad-hoc access provisioning and revocation practices can lead to excessive privileges, orphaned accounts, insider threats, and regulatory non-compliance.

H.03 – Enhanced Network Monitoring Beyond Signature-Based Detection (System-Based Perspective)
Control Description
Implement advanced network monitoring capabilities that go beyond traditional signature-based detection by incorporating behavioral analytics, anomaly detection, and machine learning to identify novel, evasive, or zero-day threats within the organization’s network environment.
As part of a comprehensive and adaptive Information Security Management System (ISMS), this control ensures the organization is equipped to detect both known and unknown attack patterns. Signature-based tools are effective for recognizing established threats, but they offer limited defense against sophisticated techniques that evade known indicators. To address this gap, enhanced monitoring tools—such as Network Detection and Response (NDR) platforms, UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics), and AI-powered threat detection engines—should be deployed to baseline normal behavior and identify deviations that may signal compromise, insider threats, or advanced persistent threats (APTs).
Risk Statement
Failure to augment traditional signature-based detection with advanced network monitoring techniques significantly limits the organization’s visibility into emerging threats. This can result in delayed detection of stealthy or targeted attacks, allowing adversaries to operate undetected within the network—leading to data compromise, business disruption, or regulatory violations.
Business Impact
•	Inability to detect novel or polymorphic attacks, increasing breach risk
•	Prolonged attacker dwell time due to lack of behavioral or anomaly-based detection
•	Delayed incident response and greater damage scope
•	Failure to meet expectations for proactive threat detection in audits and assessments
•	Reputational harm from missed threats or long-undetected compromises

H.04 – Application Firewalls for Critical Servers (System-Based Perspective)
Control Description
Implement application-layer firewall controls—such as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)—to protect critical servers by inspecting, filtering, and validating application traffic in real time. These controls form part of a system-integrated, defense-in-depth strategy to detect and block threats that traditional network firewalls may miss.
Critical systems that host sensitive applications or data are frequent targets of application-level attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and protocol abuses. Unlike traditional firewalls that filter based on IP and port rules, application firewalls evaluate the behavior and structure of traffic, enforcing granular rules and validating the legitimacy of requests at the application level. Positioned logically in front of high-risk systems (e.g., web servers, APIs, CRM/ERP platforms), application firewalls can actively prevent exploitation attempts and reduce the surface area exposed to internet-facing threats.
Risk Statement
Without application firewalls, critical systems are exposed to sophisticated attacks that bypass traditional controls. The lack of deep inspection of application-layer traffic increases the likelihood of successful intrusions, data compromise, and regulatory non-compliance. This can result in significant operational, financial, and reputational damage.
Business Impact
•	Successful exploitation of web-based applications or APIs through input manipulation or protocol abuse
•	Breaches of systems containing regulated or sensitive customer data

H.05 – Network-Based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) (System-Based Perspective)
Control Description
Deploy and maintain network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) at critical ingress and egress points within the organization’s IT environment to detect, log, and alert on suspicious traffic patterns, known attack signatures, and policy violations in real time.
As part of a layered defense strategy embedded within the organization’s Information Security Management System (ISMS), IDS sensors enhance visibility into network activity and provide early warning capabilities for unauthorized access attempts, malware propagation, data exfiltration, and misuse of internal services. By inspecting traffic at the network perimeter, demilitarized zones (DMZs), and internal segmentation points, IDS solutions serve as a foundational component of proactive threat detection. Regular signature updates, centralized alert management, and log correlation ensure the IDS contributes to broader incident detection, response, and compliance efforts.
Risk Statement
Failure to deploy and properly maintain IDS sensors at key network boundaries increases the likelihood that malicious activity will go unnoticed. Without real-time traffic inspection and alerting, organizations may face delayed breach detection, insufficient forensic data, and inadequate incident response—leading to increased exposure, legal liability, and reputational damage.
Business Impact

M.14 – Network Border Information Flow Control Policy (System-Based Perspective)
Control Description
Establish and enforce a policy to govern and secure the flow of information across network boundary points through the use of perimeter defense systems such as firewalls, web proxies, secure gateways, data loss prevention (DLP) tools, and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS). This policy ensures that only validated, encrypted, and authorized traffic enters or leaves the organization’s network, minimizing exposure to cyber threats and data leakage.
As part of a defense-in-depth architecture, this control requires the integration of network flow enforcement tools with centralized monitoring and threat detection systems. Border controls must enforce traffic restrictions based on source/destination, protocols, data type, application behavior, and content sensitivity, while supporting real-time analysis and anomaly detection. Configuration and rule changes must be governed by formal change control procedures, and all flows must be aligned with business justification and regulatory constraints (e.g., data sovereignty, export controls).

H.07 – Network Boundary Traffic and Content Inspection (System-Based Perspective)
Control Description
Establish a comprehensive, system-integrated policy for inspecting and controlling traffic at all network boundaries, using a combination of next-generation firewalls (NGFWs), deep packet inspection (DPI), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), behavioral detection, and content filtering technologies.
This control is critical for maintaining perimeter defense and detecting threats such as malware infiltration, data exfiltration, command-and-control (C2) communication, or policy violations. Network boundary inspection should include real-time traffic analysis, application-aware filtering, and automated rule enforcement to block known attack vectors and suspicious patterns. Integration with SIEM, network detection and response (NDR), and data loss prevention (DLP) tools ensures actionable visibility and threat correlation across the network perimeter.
Risk Statement
Without comprehensive inspection of traffic and content crossing network boundaries, malicious activity may go undetected, leading to prolonged attacker presence, data leaks, and regulatory violations. Weak perimeter controls can be exploited for lateral movement, privilege escalation, and long-term compromise.
Business Impact
•	Increased risk of advanced persistent threats (APTs) entering or maintaining presence undetected
•	Unmonitored data exfiltration resulting in regulatory violations or loss of intellectual property
•	Financial loss due to breaches, ransomware, or business interruption
•	Reputational harm and erosion of stakeholder trust

H.08 – Network Segmentation and Zoning (System-Based Perspective)
Control Description
Implement a policy and supporting technical architecture to segment the organizational network into logical security zones based on risk level, sensitivity, trust, and function. Network segmentation reduces the attack surface and limits lateral movement by separating systems such as user workstations, critical infrastructure, development environments, and externally exposed services.
This control requires the use of virtual LANs (VLANs), firewalls, network access control (NAC), software-defined networking (SDN), and zero-trust enforcement to ensure that only explicitly authorized traffic can flow between zones. Boundaries between segments must be monitored with traffic inspection tools (e.g., IDS/IPS, NDR) and changes to segmentation rules must be governed through configuration and change control processes.
Risk Statement
Without segmentation or zoning, attackers who gain access to any part of the internal network may move laterally to compromise critical systems or sensitive data. Lack of logical separation undermines incident containment, weakens compliance posture, and exposes the organization to widespread damage during security events.
Business Impact
•	Rapid attacker propagation across systems due to flat or poorly segmented networks
•	Greater difficulty in isolating compromised assets during incident response
•	Violations of regulatory requirements mandating separation of duties and access control boundaries
•	Prolonged operational outages during ransomware or malware outbreaks

•	Roles and responsibilities (e.g., Security Operations, IT, Legal, Communications)
•	Detection mechanisms such as SIEMs, EDRs, anomaly detection, IDS/IPS, and user reporting
•	Incident classification and escalation criteria
•	Containment, eradication, and remediation procedures
•	Recovery plans to restore systems and data integrity
•	Communication protocols including internal updates and external notifications (e.g., regulatory, contractual)
•	Forensic and evidence collection procedures for legal, compliance, or disciplinary needs
•	Lessons learned analysis to feed into risk treatment, awareness training, and control enhancement
The policy should be supported by automated playbooks, ticketing systems, and runbooks integrated into your Security Incident Response Platform (SIRP) or SIEM, ensuring a repeatable, audit-ready process aligned with regulatory obligations and business continuity goals.

H.10 – Proactive Verification of Security Controls (System-Based Perspective)
Control Description
Establish and maintain a formal process to proactively verify the effectiveness of security controls through continuous testing, monitoring, and assurance activities. This verification ensures that technical, physical, and procedural controls operate as intended and continue to align with the organization’s risk appetite, regulatory obligations, and business needs.
Control validation may include:
•	Automated security control assessments (e.g., CSPM, GRC toolsets, SCAP-based scans)
•	Vulnerability scanning and remediation tracking
•	Internal audits and technical configuration reviews
•	Penetration testing and red/purple team simulations
•	Tabletop exercises and incident response walk-throughs
This control should be supported by control owners, audit/compliance teams, and automated assurance platforms to ensure validation activities are timely, traceable, and risk-prioritized.
________________________________________
Risk Statement
If security controls are not proactively verified, the organization may unknowingly operate with ineffective, misconfigured, or outdated controls—exposing critical systems and data to unmitigated risk.
________________________________________
Business Impact
•	Unseen control weaknesses leave critical assets vulnerable
•	Failure to detect control degradation following system changes or updates
•	Inability to prove control effectiveness during audits or due diligence
•	Greater likelihood of compliance violations or fines
•	Reputational damage following a preventable breach or misconfiguration
